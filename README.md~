**Thoughts:** Had to change the way I was processing data. Used getJSON to get data. 
Used it inside a loop and formed the dom elements directly. Also used a nested getJSON 
(the 1st being for user data nd the 2nd being for user status) 
The above process was fine if we had to display the data just once. 
But we have some buttons by which we can switch display to all, offline or online channels. 
So for this I decided to use deferred objects. Used when and then. 
However by this process, my nested getJSON stopped working. Tried to get it to work then realised like we 
are putting all getJSON calls into a stack, we can do the same thing for the getJSON statement we used to get 
the status of a channel (the one which was a nested getJSON previously. -- we were directly creating dom elements in 
the success callback of 1st getJSON and in the same callback had the nested 2nd getJSON which was creating the status 
part of the row and only in the success callback of the second getJSON did we append all the elements to dom.
